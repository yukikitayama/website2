Hibernate EC2 instances
- Save the instance memory (RAM) data to Amazon Elastic Block Store root volume.
- When you restart the instance, RAM contents are reloaded, previously running processes are resumed, previously attached data volumnes are reattached.
- Hibernation stores private and elastic IP addresses.
